## 💡 How to Use This Repository

### For Beginners

1. Start with the **Array** section to understand basic problem-solving patterns
2. Study one problem at a time, reading through the explanation
3. Attempt the problem yourself before looking at the solution
4. Understand the time and space complexity

### For Intermediate Users

1. Focus on **Data Structures** and **Algorithm Paradigms**
2. Practice solving problems without looking at solutions first
3. Optimize solutions for better time/space complexity
4. Solve similar problems to reinforce concepts

### For Advanced Users

1. Tackle **Dynamic Programming** and **Graph** problems
2. Solve multiple problems using different approaches
3. Focus on optimal solutions
4. Contribute your own solutions and explanations

### Problem File Format

Each problem file typically includes:

```python
"""
Problem: Problem Name
Difficulty: Easy/Medium/Hard
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Description:
[Problem statement here]

Example:
Input: [1, 2, 3]
Output: 6

Approach:
[Explanation of approach]
"""

def solution(input_param):
    # Solution code
    pass

# Test cases
if __name__ == "__main__":
    assert solution(...) == expected_output
```
